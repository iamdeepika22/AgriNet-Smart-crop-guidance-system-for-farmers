# AgriNet-Smart-crop-guidance-system-for-farmers

**Introduction **
we developed a web portal for farmers using Machine learning and Deep Learning which helps farmers by predicting right crop for cultivation and recommending crop, recommendation of fertilizer and prediction of crop diseases. It helps farmers to increase crop yield and increases the country economy. Design and development of “SMART CROP GUIDANCE SYSTEM FOR FARMERS” agricultural framework based on machine learning and in deep learning algorithms is proposed. Our project aims to help the farmers by recommending crop, fertilizers and also by predicting the plant diseases to avoid spread of crop diseases

Modules
**Crop Prediction Module **
Nitrogen, Phosphorous, Potassium (NPK) and pH values of the soil, climatic conditions, rainfall, location, humidity, temperature, upcoming weather data using Random forest Algorithm it Predict the right crop and recommend crop to farmers
**Fertilizer Recommendation Module**
NPK and PH value of soil and type of Crop is inputted to the module using Random Forest Algorithm and it recommend Fertilizer 
**Crop Disease Prediction Module**
Image of a diseased plant leaf is the inputted to the module using ResNet Architecture find the Crop disease prediction and suggestion to cure disease
